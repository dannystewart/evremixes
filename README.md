# Evanescence Remix Scripts

Various download and conversion scripts for my Evanescence remixes.

## evdownloader.sh (the main script)

This is the one meant to be easily used by anybody. Just run this:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://dnst.me/evdl)"
```

This leads to `evdownloader.sh` which grabs a JSON of all my current remixes and uses that to download them to your `~/Downloads` folder. Files come pre-tagged and are ready to import into something like Apple Music.

## Python Scripts

### evremixes.py

This is a fancier Python version of the main download script. This one handles the conversion from FLAC to ALAC (as well as metadata tagging) locally on your machine. I wanted to use this by default because it's way cooler, but I switched because there were too many dependencies I couldn't rely on others having.

It supports Windows, and you can also now use `--flac` if you want to keep the original FLAC files instead of converting them to ALAC. It will still tag them with the correct metadata and album art.

### evconverter.py

This is what I use to convert the FLAC files to ALAC, tag them, and re-upload them to Azure so they can be downloaded by the main Bash script. (I do the heavy lifting so you don't have to!)

### evtelegram.py

This is a cool script I wrote to convert, tag, and upload selected remixes to a Telegram channel. It tracks uploads so it can later delete them when replacing a song, but unfortunately due to Telegram limitations, bots can only delete messages for 48 hours, so anything older still needs to be deleted manually.

## Python Setup and Usage

You should probably follow a real guide to install Python using `pyenv`, like [this one](https://www.pythoncentral.io/installing-python-on-mac-using-homebrew/) or [this one](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/), but here are the absolute basics. It does require some level of familiarity with installing packages via Homebrew.

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) first if you don't already have it:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Pay attention to the output, because you will need to add `brew` to your path to use it. (It says how.)

2. Install Python:
```bash
brew install python
```
3. Clone this repository and then install the necessary Python dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://git.dannystewart.com/danny/evremixes.git
cd evremixes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run a script, just run `python scriptname.py` (replacing the script name, obviously).

### Binaries

There are precompiled binaries that avoid the need to have Python or its depenedencies, but as noted above, they are dependent on platform architecture, so you'll need to run the x86 one on Intel and the ARM one on Apple Silicon.

The other issue is that even with dependencies included it still needs `ffmpeg` to do the actual conversions, so even binaries don't fully solve the dependency issue.

The scripts are in the `dist` directory. Just `cd` from there to either `x86` or `arm` depending on your platform, then make it executable with `chmod +x ./evremixes` and `./evremixes` to run it.

## Other Notes

### How to update/replace albums/songs in Apple Music

It's always easiest if you have metadata on the files before importing. [Meta](https://www.nightbirdsevolve.com/meta/) is a great app for this, but you don't need to worry about it here as that's the point of all this, obviously.

#### Remove the old albums/songs

1. Open Apple Music.
2. Look in the bottom left corner for "Updating Cloud Music Library." Wait for this to finish and disappear.
3. Right-click the albums/songs and click Delete from Library.
4. Go to File > Library > Update Cloud Library, and again look in the bottom left for "Updating Cloud Music Library" and wait for it to finish.

You need to wait for it to completely sync the removal of the album. If you re-import before it's fully flushed out, you can end up with duplicates or have your new copies overwritten by the old versions.

#### Re-import the albums/songs

6. Go to File > Importâ€¦.
7. Select the song file(s) or the entire folder containing the album and click Open.
8. Wait for it to import everything and verify that the album and metadata all look correct.
9. One more time, go to File > Library > Update Cloud Library and wait for it to finish.

If in doubt, it never hurts to run a sync twice. It can also help to have another device nearby to watch and make sure the changes are syncing correctly.
